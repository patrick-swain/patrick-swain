Hey there!

I'm Patrick, and the present iteration of me is a recent graduate with an M.S. in quantitative economics from the University of Pittsburgh. I'm a data storyteller, policy wonk, and Oxford comma enthusiast eager to navigate the intersections of data, culture, and public policy. Outside of the classroom, I have experience in economic data analysis, journalism, renewable energy finance, social studies and language education, business research, and state government. My research interests include news media and data storytelling, urban development and human geography, and international political economy and elections. 

In my spare time, I'm a musician and recording artist, and I love exploring and writing about global cultures and languages. I'm known to shed a tear at the sound of the bagpipes and I aspire to someday invoke the Third Amendment. When I'm not nose-deep in a recreational spreadsheet, you can find me rooting for the Buffalo Bills, reading interpretive signage, and remembering the Alamo.

Taking a look around? I finished my Master's in May 2025, and if you're hiring, I'd love to throw my hat in the ring!
